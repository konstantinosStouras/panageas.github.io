About Me
======
I am an Assistant Professor in [Information Systems](https://istd.sutd.edu.sg/) at [SUTD](https://www.sutd.edu.sg/). Before that I was a MIT Postdoctoral Fellow working with [Costis Daskalakis](http://people.csail.mit.edu/costis/). I obtained my PhD in [Algorithms, Combinatorics, and Optimization (ACO)](https://www.aco.gatech.edu/) at [Georgia Tech](https://www.gatech.edu/), advised by [Prasad Tetali](http://people.math.gatech.edu/~tetali/). At Georgia Tech, I also obtained a MSc in Mathematics. I did my undergrad studies in [National Technical University of Athens](https://www.ntua.gr/en/). 

Interests
======
I am interested in theory of computation and its interface with optimization, dynamical systems, probability and statistics, machine learning and their applications to game theory, evolution and dynamics on networks. <br/>
Here is my [CV](https://panageasj.github.io/files/cv.pdf)
